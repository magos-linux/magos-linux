</h3>

<p>
Press <em>@@@fkey_videom@@@</em> to get the list of video modes which are 
using while booting. This parameter does not affect xorg graphical
server resolution.
</p>

<p>
The default resolution set to 1024x768.
It is possible that your videocard/monitor cannot work with default resolution.
In that case, select your preferred mode manually.
</p>

<p>
If your system has problems with the graphics card during the
booting, the <em>text mode</em> may be a usable work-around.
