# Set USE_LOCARCHIVE to yes/true/1 if you want locale scripts to create and
# maintain /usr/share/locale/locale-archive. locale-archive can speed up
# loading of applications, but they duplicate locale information already
# present in /usr/share/locale/xx_XX/* directories, so if you need to save
# disk space you can disable it with this switch. If you disable it, you can
# delete /usr/share/locale/locale-archive file, otherwise it will be removed
# automatically on next locale scripts run, on locales package update
